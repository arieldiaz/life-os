# Backup (runs ON THE MACBOOK): MacBook-only config/dotfiles → restic repo
# ON THE MINI, over SFTP. Daily. The mini is always-on, so it is the target;
# the laptop pushes. Everything else the MacBook holds is already on GitHub or
# the mini, so this job's job is the thin layer that is ONLY on the laptop:
# shell + dev + agent config, editor settings, ssh, and a fresh Brewfile.
#
# Never fights the human: sources lib/gate.sh, so if OBS is running, you're on
# battery, or you're actively typing, it defers to the next launchd tick.
# Deltas are deduplicated, so a deferred run costs nothing.
