# Operating rules for agents in this repo

You are working inside a life-os — the operating system for its owner's life. These rules override your defaults.

## Ground rules

1. **The stream is append-only and lives OUTSIDE this repo** (see `STREAM.md`). Never edit, rename, move, or delete anything in it. New captures only, following the naming convention in `STREAM.md`. If asked to "fix" something in the stream, capture a correction as a *new* event instead.
2. **Orient before acting.** At the start of any non-trivial task, read `STRATEGY.md` and `memory/index.md`. Cheap to read, expensive to skip.
3. **End real work with compounding.** If a session produced a lesson — about the work or about the process — offer to run `/compound` before closing. Don't compound trivia.
4. **Verification is proportional, not ritual.** High stakes (irreversible, public, financial, relational) → verify hard, get evidence. Low stakes → ship it. No TDD dogma; write tests where they earn their keep.
5. **Questions go inline, one at a time.** Plain conversational questions in the chat. No popup/form question widgets — ever.
6. **Prose over ceremony.** Outputs are readable paragraphs, not checkbox theater. Bullets only when structure genuinely helps.
7. **`derived/` is disposable.** Regenerate freely, overwrite freely. Note the source stream events and model/date in a header so future rederivation knows what it's replacing.
8. **`memory/` is curated, not accumulated.** When adding a lesson, check for an existing one to merge into. Keep `memory/index.md` current. A memory system that only grows becomes noise.
9. **This framework edits itself.** If a compounded lesson is about the process, propose an edit to the relevant skill file. Skills are drafts, permanently.
10. **Privacy tiers are hard rules.** The external stream is Tier 0: raw data stays on this network and is derived by **local models only** (Whisper + Qwen on the Mac mini, via `ops/`). If you are a cloud model, do not read stream contents into your context, and never transmit them anywhere. You may *write* new events the human gave you in-session (into the spool), and read a specific raw item only when the human explicitly hands it to you, per item. `derived/` is Tier 1: local by default, shareable into a session deliberately. `memory/`, `STRATEGY.md`, and skills are Tier 2: your normal working set. When derivation of raw media is needed, route it to the local pipeline rather than doing it yourself.
11. **Many agents work here — behave like it.** Assume other AI sessions (cloud and local) touch this repo. Re-read `memory/index.md` and any file you're about to edit at time of use, not from stale context. Commit small with descriptive messages. Never restructure directories, rewrite conventions, or mass-edit files without explicit human sign-off in the current session.
12. **Links are standard markdown, never `[[wikilinks]]`.** This vault is read in Obsidian and by agents alike; every link must work in both. Relative paths from repo root.
13. **Sessions run as an agent when one fits.** If the human addresses Liv or Max (or the session clearly belongs to one), load that agent file from `agents/` on top of these rules and stay in role: Liv for personal-life and system-cadence work, Max for anything on the work side. Agent definition files stay template-clean — personal facts about the human compound into `memory/`, never into `agents/*.md`.
14. **Stream data never enters this repo.** Not committed, not copied in "temporarily," not embedded in derived files as raw media. The repo holds text *about* events (with provenance paths pointing at the external store), never the events. Stream durability comes from the mini + NAS backups, not version control.
15. **Secrets live in the owned secrets manager, never in files.** If the instance runs the self-hosted Infisical layer (`infra/secrets/runbook.md`), every credential comes from there: dev commands run under `infisical run -- <cmd>`, daemons hydrate their environment at launch, and agents authenticate with read-only machine identities scoped to their own paths. No `.env` files with real values anywhere (`.env.example` placeholders are fine). Hard rule for every agent: never write a secret value into an instruction file, memory file, log, commit, task description, or reply — reference keys by name only, and if a value ever leaks into one of those places, stop, flag it for rotation, scrub, then continue.

## Where things go

| It is... | It goes to... |
|----------|---------------|
| Raw input (audio, video, image, article, note-as-received) | The external stream spool (`$STREAM_LOCAL/YYYY/MM/DD/`, see `STREAM.md` and `ops/`) — never this repo |
| A transcript, summary, index, report | `derived/` |
| A durable lesson or observed pattern | `memory/lessons/` or `memory/patterns/` |
| A change to who/what/why | `STRATEGY.md` (with the old version's insight preserved — the file evolves, the stream remembers) |
| A secret (API key, token, credential) | Self-hosted Infisical (`infra/secrets/`) — never a file in this repo |
